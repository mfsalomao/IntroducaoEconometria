Installation Instructions

This program will install the gretl data files that accompany the
manual Using gretl for Principles of Econometrics, 4th edition. The
scripts and datasets are distributed without warranty and are subject
to the copyrights associated with the book Principles of
Econometrics, 4th edition (by Hill, Griffiths, and Lim) published by
John Wiley and Sons, 2011.

I assume that your main gretl directory is set to C:\Program
Files\gretl (the default location in Windows) and that you have the
necessary privileges to write files here.  The program will install
the data files to "c:\Program Files (x86)\gretl\data\poe".  It will allow you
to choose another location.

Early versions of gretl installed to c:\userdata\gretl so pay
attention to where gretl actually installs on your machine.

Once installed, open gretl, click on File>Open data>Sample file and
this will bring up the list of datasets under the poe tab.  Have fun!
